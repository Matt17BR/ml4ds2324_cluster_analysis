In this folder we have saved all the images generated through the data analysis. 

`PERD_GR.png` showcases the power loss of rotary UPS over time.

`POT_TR_SOMMA.png` showcases the sum of the transformer apparent power over time.

The images `TR_Corr.png`, `TR_cosFi.png`, `TR_N.png`, `TR_Pot_att.png` contain the plots that showcase the change in those variables across time.

`K-means_distortion.png` and `K-means_silhouette.png` contain the figures resulting from implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.

`PCA_DBSCAN.png` and `PCA_K-means.png` contain the PCA plots obtained from DBSCAN and K-means clustering.

`Timeline_DBSCAN.png` and `Timeline_K-means.png` contain the timeline plots of the respective clusters over time.

`Correlation_no_NA.png` and `Correlation_all.png` contain the heat maps of the correlation matrix of all the variables with non-NA values and all values respectively.

`Standardized_plot.png` contains the plot of all standardized variables over time. 

`Violin_median.png` contains the violin plots of all the variables plotted individually.
