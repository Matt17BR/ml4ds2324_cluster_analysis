This folder contains the scripts developed through the data analysis of this project. 

`merge_csv.ipynb` contains the code written for merging all the individual datasets together. 

`exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` contains the exploratory data analysis on the full dataset. The hourly and daily means were taken of the preprocessed variables, which were first grouped and plotted over time and then standardized. For identifying patterns and information of interest, the use of various data visualization techniques was implemented, such as: the correlation heat maps, and the violin plot.

`cluster_analysis.ipynb` contains the code for all the different clustering techniques implemented, mainly DBSCAN and k-means. Similarly data visualization was implemented through the elbow plot, PCA plots and timeline plots of the clusters.
