- Explore data in a meaningful way
- Define research questions
- Identify data variation with respect to the median value
- Use k-means and DBSCAN techniques to identify patterns
- Define labels (for each cluster???) if possible
- Does it make sense to maybe take hourly means instead of daily means?
- Make tables prettier (consider e.g. making correlation matrix a heatmap plot)
- Suppress messages/warnings
- Doesn't make sense to have the pairs plot like that -> use factor/pca space plots instead
